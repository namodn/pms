------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

	PMS is a mail sorter written in perl. Designed to provide the same
   basic features of procmail (i.e. sorting incoming mail into specified
   mailboxes), it provides a more "basic" approach to this task. The
   config file is more human readable, and does not provide as much of
   the advanced features that procmail does, which helps to keep simple
   tasks simple. The main purpose of this program is to provide and quick
   & easy way to get your mail filtered when you don't have any use for
   the power, and complexity, of procmail.

==============================================================================

Installation:

	There isn't much to installing PMS, though I figure'd I go over some
   information that might be usefull.

	Typically, the pms executable should go in /usr/local/sbin, however
   if your MTA is set up extra secure, there might be a specified directory 
   that it is allowed to run programs from, and no other directory. The
   directory is usually something like /etc/smrsh/ or /usr/lib/sm.bin/ 
   depending on your distro & MTA configuration. If this is the case you will 
   need to either put pms in this directory, or just make a symlink from 
   /usr/local/sbin/pms to the sendmail secure directory (recomended).

	You will need to make a .pmsrc in your home directory, a sample rc
   file should be included in this tar file, it's called sample.pmsrc. You
   should make a copy of this, name it .pmsrc and set up your filtering rules.
   When you are sure everything is correct in the config file, and it is in
   your home directory named .pmsrc, run the following command:
   
	$ pms -rc

	This should run through your $HOME/.pmsrc and let you know of any
   syntax erros. If all is well edit your .forward and put in the following: 

	"| /usr/local/sbin/pms"

	If your MTA is set up how I mentioned in the above paragraph,
   then you should replace /usr/local/sbin with the path to your MTA's secure
   directory.

	Now all incoming mail gets piped through pms which reads your .pmsrc
   and attempts to match the patterns as you specify, if it makes a match, it
   will put the email message in the file you specified.


==============================================================================

Command Line Parameters:

	PMS runs with no parameters, the only command line options
    available are stricly for syntax checking of the .pmsrc file.

	Syntax Checking: pms -rc <file>

	Note: leaving out the <file> name defaults to the users
	      .pmsrc in their home directory.

    (and of course: 'pms --help' will display this help screen)

RC File:  ~/.pmsrc

   #	 syntax:  :$
   #		  <H|B><,value| >='<value>'
   #		  <path & filename to append message to>
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   #
   # :$			= Begin new chunk (manditory)
   # <H|B>		= look in 'H'eader or 'B'ody
   # <,value| >		= if 'H'eader then ',<value>' is the header name.
   #		  	  if 'B'ody then no value (i.e. B = '<value>')
